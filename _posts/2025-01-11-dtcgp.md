## Overview
---
- Deep Temporal Clustering for Gait Pattern (DTCGP) was a collaborative project I worked in [Helper Lab](https://hlab.skku.edu/){:target="_blank"}, Sungkyunkwan university supervised by professor [Mun-Taek Choi](https://robot.skku.edu/robot_en/faculty.do?mode=view&perId=LZStrBwOQlgzg6gdgkgDwIYCkDCAhATAUzABhgHEBOHALQEEBeaoA%20&){:target="_blank"}.

- The paper was accepted and published by MDPI Bioengineering.

## Goal
---
- The objective of this cross-sectional study aims to implement an end-to-end deep learning (DL) approach that directly utilizes time-series gait cycle data as model input, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction.


## Description
---
- DTCGP uses the data consisted of time-normalized joint angle trajectories, motion-captured during independent gaits of sub-acute hemiplegic post-stroke patients at Samsung Medical Center (SMC).

- As input data for the DL, joint angles and angular velocity trajectories in the sagittal plane are utilized as an instance.

- DTCGP is based on the existing Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC) algorithm, which is composed of temporal autoencoder and clustering layer with simultaneous optimization, by Madiraju et al.

- With hyperparameter tuning tailored for kinematic gait cycle data, six optimal clusters are selected with a silhouette score of 0.2831.

- To clarify the characteristics of the selected groups, in-depth statistics of spatiotemporal, kinematic, and clinical features are presented.
