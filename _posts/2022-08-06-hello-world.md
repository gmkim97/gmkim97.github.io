## Introduction

Hello! My name is GMKim. It's the first time to make my own blog and write posts, so I'm very unfamiliar with its system.  
To connect my personal repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/gmkim97?tab=repositories){:target="_blank"}, I choose this GitHub Pages for the blogging.  
And of course, the existence of a lot of examples that I can refer to is also one of the attractions GitHub Pages has.  

## Who am I?

Currently, I am an undergraduate student and my major is Mechanical Engineering (ME).  
I have an interest on `Robotics`, `Machine Learning`,and `Vision`.  
Thus, most of the posts on this blog will be related to above topics.  
Plus, after I have some progress on my works or projects, I will try to upload its outcome on the GitHub, and you can check through the link. 

## Purpose

As I mentioned earlier, I'm going to upload some progress, error, or anything else related to Robotics, Machine Learning, Vision on here.  
Well, the reasons why I make this homepage are  

1. Like Sticker Notes, To see various knowledges or informations which were written earlier, anytime, anywhere.
2. To categorize these understandings mixed in my head.
3. To share, or learn better ideas.
4. Most importantly, To be diligent.
