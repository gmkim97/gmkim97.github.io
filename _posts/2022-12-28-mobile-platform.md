## Overview
---
- This was a *collaborative* project I worked with Seung Jin Yang under the guidance of the [Robotics Innovatory lab](https://mecha.skku.ac.kr/roboticsinnovatory/index.do){:target="_blank"}.

- It was submitted to AI-ICT Creative Idea Contest hosted by Sungkyunkwan University. - *3rd prize*


## Goal
---
- To design a scalable mobile platform hardware that can support additional sensors, algorithms, and hardware for future use.

- Also, to enable basic navigation using a LiDAR sensor.


## Description
---
- Hardware
    - Designed with reference to various commercial mobile robots, it maintains a low height to allow for additional modules on top and adopts a rounded shape to account for environments with many people nearby.
    - Using aluminum profiles for the internal structure to enhance robot stability.
    - For cost efficiency, the robotâ€™s exterior was designed in AutoDesk Inventor and then 3D printed for assembly.

- Navigation
    - Utilizes a YDLidar sensor to gather surrounding environmental data, enabling distance measurements essential for navigation tasks.
    - Operates in ROS1 Noetic environment.
    - Mapping: Hector mapping
    - Localization: AMCL
    - Global navigation: A* algorithm
    - Local navigation: Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)
