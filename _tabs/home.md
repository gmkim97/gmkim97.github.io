Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Gyeongmin Kim (GM Kim), and I am currently in the Master’s course in the [Helper Lab](https://hlab.skku.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the [Department of Intelligent Robotics](https://robot.skku.edu/robot_en/index.do){:target="_blank"}, Sungkyunkwan University, advised by Professor [Mun-Taek Choi](https://robot.skku.edu/robot_en/faculty.do?mode=view&perId=LZStrBwOQlgzg6gdgkgDwIYCkDCAhATAUzABhgHEBOHALQEEBeaoA%20&){:target="_blank"}.  

My research interest includes:
- Human-Robot Interaction
- Data-driven Control
- Robot Learning
- Computer Vision

Throughout several research experiences and competitions, I have gained a broad range of skills not only from mechanical design but also from software algorithms. Of course, I’m still working hard on deep reinforcement learning and data-driven control.  

If you want to get more information about me in detail, you can check my CV ([PDF](../assets/pdf/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf){:target="_blank"}; updated 2024/12/03) or contact me via e-mail ([hn04008@skku.edu](mailto:hn04008@skku.edu)).
